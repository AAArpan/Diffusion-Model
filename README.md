# Diffusion-Model
Here I trained Denoising Diffusion Model and sampled the newly the generated images from it. Dataset used was [CelebA](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) having 202,599 number of face images. For any other dataset just change the [model_params.yaml](model_params.yaml) file accordingly.
